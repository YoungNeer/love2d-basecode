# Awesome Base-code for your LÃ–VE (ly) Game

The goal of this repository is to make - making games much faster. Almost every game-jam out there allows you to use base-code and you may use base-code from your own game. But the problem is time and customization. Plucking out code from your game to use in another game can get very ugly and may sometimes take a lot of time and customization is also very difficult. So to solve this problem I recommended that you arrange base-code the way you arrange clothes in your wardrobe - all lined up in a closet or in this context all filed up in folder.

To get an idea of what I'm saying here's an example screenshot:-

## Templates Arrangement

You can think each sub-repository as templates but I insist on calling them "states" like "HighScore State", "MainMenu State", etc. Each of these folders have more folders in it - which is "Look and Feel" (the idea is borrowed from Java). So *there's not one HighScoreState but several of them* - depending on the game that you are developing for eg.- casual, sci-fi, etc
